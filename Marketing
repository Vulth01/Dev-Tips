Just make great games.
And the right games.

### Genre
  Good:
    - Horror
    - Crafting / Building (LEGO)
    - Simulation
    - Management
  
  Difficult:
    - Platformers (2D, 3D)
    - Puzzle
    - VR
    - Local Multiplayer
    - RTS (at indie scale)

### Steam
  - Steam Page MUST look good
  - Do not launch Early Access, steam looks at those statistics and publishers will not look at your game

### Make a demo
  - Just make a demo.

### Content Creators
  - Contact 300-1000 content creators
  - Eye-catching
  - What will entertain their viewers

### Festivals
  - Demo should be released after tons of playtesting, and i.e. as a soft-launch of limited conted.
  - Should be released i.e. 1 month before the pre-release Next Fest
  - As soon as it's public, you contact all the influencers you know, so they have time to play it before the Next Fest.
  - They drive up your wishlists just before the Next Fest, causing Steam Algorithm to show your game a lot during the Fest.
  - Thus the Next Fest gets you ton of wishlists.
  (- Hopefully no major issue arises during the Festival and you can release soon after.)
  - You launch soon after and it gets promoted by Steam a lot due to the recent wishlist jump during the Next Fest.
